Did you find yourself ashamed, running command in the wrong environment ?

"Oups... I dropped the database in the prod environment..." - A guy that lost his job

This bundle want to help. Using configuration, define commands that you are not expecting to be used in your environment.

That's it...


## Installation

### Add the bundle as dependency with Composer

``` bash
composer require yokai/safe-command-bundle
```

### Enable the bundle in the kernel

``` php
<?php
// config/bundles.php

return [
    // ...
    Yokai\SafeCommandBundle\YokaiSafeCommandBundle::class => ['prod' => true],
];
```

> [!NOTE]
> The bundle is enabled only for `prod` here, but you are free to do whatever you want.

### Configuration

The bundle comes with some commands disabled by default (from Symfony's standards).

That "standard" command list can be overridden:
```
# config/packages/yokai_safe_command.yaml
when@prod:
    yokai_safe_command:
        standard: []
```

> [!NOTE]
> "standard" disabled commands are viewable via the command:
> ```
> bin/console config:dump-reference yokai_safe_command
> ```

And you can also add your own commands to the list:
```
# config/packages/yokai_safe_command.yaml
when@prod:
    yokai_safe_command:
        custom:
          - 'vendor:my:dev-command'
          - 'app:my:dev-command'
```

> [!NOTE]
> `standard` and `custom` configs are merged together to create the final list of disabled commands.
